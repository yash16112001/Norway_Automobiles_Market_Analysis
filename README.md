## **Comprehensive Analysis of Norway’s Automobile Market Trends**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of Norway's automobile market using SQL, examining trends in car sales, environmental impact, and market share. By working with three datasets—car sales by make, model, and month—we aim to uncover actionable insights for car manufacturers, policymakers, and dealerships.


## **Objectives**

**1. Analyze Sales Trends**

- Identify top-performing car makes and models.
- Evaluate year-on-year sales growth and trends.
- Examine the monthly sales distribution for electric vehicles.

**2. Environmental Impact Assessment**

- Calculate average CO2 emissions across years.
- Compare emissions between diesel and gasoline vehicles.
- Determine the contribution of electric cars to reducing emissions.

**3. Market Share Evaluation**

- Identify car makes with the highest sales and market share.
- Assess the role of imported cars in the overall sales landscape.


## **Dataset Details**

The analysis leverages the following datasets:

- **Car Sales by Make:** Year, Month, Make, Quantity, Percentage
- **Car Sales by Model:** Year, Month, Make, Model, Quantity, Percentage
- **Car Sales by Month:** Quantity_YoY, Import, Import_YoY, Used, Avg_CO2, Diesel_Share, Quantity_Electric, and more.


## **Business Questions Addressed**

The project includes queries and insights on topics such as:

1. Top 5 car makes and models by sales quantity.
2. Yearly breakdown of car sales for each make.
3. Trends in electric vehicle sales and CO2 emissions.
4. Year-on-year growth rates and classification of car makes based on sales quantity.

For a detailed list of queries and interpretations, refer to the Problem Statement document.


## **Key Insights**

**1. Electric Vehicles Growth**

- Sales of electric vehicles increased consistently after 2011, marking a shift in consumer preference.

**2. Diesel Cars Decline**

- Diesel car sales declined significantly after 2013, emphasizing the need for brands to pivot toward hybrid and electric models.

**3. Market Leaders**
